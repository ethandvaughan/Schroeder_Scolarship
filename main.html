			<h1>Thomas and Jill Schroeder Scolarship</h1>
			<p>Hi, I&#x27m Mark Vaughan, Placer High class of &#x2788, speaking about the Thomas and Jill Schroeder Scholarship.  Thomas and Jill were faculty at Placer High School from the late 1980&#x27s to Thomas&#x27s retirement at the end of this 2021 school year.  Thomas and Jill both served their students beyond the classroom, including mentoring through off-campus boys and girls Bible studies.  Thomas was both keyboardist and vocalist for the Rotating Blockheads at Palooza.  They also hosted 19 cultural exchange trips to Tasillo, Germany.  Jill invested herself into Special Education students, making a splash with the rest of the campus through &#8221smoothie club.&#8221  Thomas was an inspiration to students in his Anatomy and Physiology.  It was in this class where a number of medical doctors found their earliest exposure to the wonder of human biology.</p>

			<p>As Thomas and Jill transition to another chapter, I can think of no more appropriate way to honor their years of service than to establish a scholarship in their names for deserving health professions students.  You can participate.  The scholarship will be administered through the Hillmen Foundation.  Please use the link in the description of this video to learn more about how you can participate in this recognition of Thomas and Jill.</p>
